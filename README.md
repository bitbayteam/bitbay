What is Bitbay?
------------------

BitBay will introduce a completely unique, open, and decentralized marketplace that allows anyone - in any country - to participate regardless of government boundaries.
BitBay will  provide a stable, secure, and safe environment to buy and sell products and services over the internet.
Our technology runs on top of a blockchain decentralized network which ensures that reliability, performance, and accuracy is guaranteed at all times. Theft is not possible through BitBay.
The platform, by design, contains no single point of control, points of failure, or single points of security.
All crucial functions are decentralized and consensus-driven by all users participating in the network.
BitBay is designed with low barriers of entry, allowing anyone to become a reputable merchant or to participate as a buyer, all based on multisig + smart contracts.
We will be the first to succeed in developing a free and democratically decentralized global marketplace.
